# Crypto Pals Exercises:
    Python code using jupyter notebook to facilitate in completeing
    the CryptoPals Exercises founf here:  www.cryptopals.com

    If you want to run the program challenges, open the Challenge_List
    in jupyter notebook, uncomment a challenge line, and run the cell.
    The result should be displayed under the current cell.

    If you want to look at the challenge structure, open the Main_Functions.py
    file and find the challenge number.  This will show the inputs, operations
    and outputs for each challenge.

    All challenges use functions from Major_Functions.py or Base_Functions.py.
    In the process of completeing these challenges, I want to make these functions
    workable as a suite of tools, useful for other projects; possibly a recoding
    adventure back into C++ for some hopeful performance gains and analysis.

    *** It should be noted that this is currently a living document, and changes/
    updates will be made.  Wording of functions, and descriptions will change
    based on improvements in understanding and overall comprehension.
    Effort is made to try and speak clearly and concisely!
